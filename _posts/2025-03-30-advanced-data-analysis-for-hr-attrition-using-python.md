# **Understanding Employee Attrition & Performance with IBM HR Data**

## **Introduction**

Employee attrition is a critical challenge for companies, impacting productivity, costs, and workplace morale. Using **IBM HR data**, this project uncovers patterns in attrition and provides **data-driven insights** to help businesses improve retention strategies.

## **Key Objectives**

*   Identify **demographic, professional, and behavioral factors** contributing to attrition.
    
*   Analyze correlations between **salary, job satisfaction, workload, and attrition rates**.
    
*   Build predictive models to **assess attrition risk** and guide HR interventions.
    
*   Offer **strategic recommendations** to reduce turnover and retain top talent.
    

## **Project Workflow**

### **1\. Data Exploration & Cleaning**

The dataset contains employee demographics, compensation details, job roles, and satisfaction scores. Initial processing includes:

*   Removing redundant features and handling missing values.
    
*   Standardizing categorical variables for consistency.
    

### **2\. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Key patterns emerged during analysis:

*   **Younger employees** and **single professionals** showed higher attrition rates.
    
*   **Lower salaries** and **overtime work** significantly increased attrition risk.
    
*   **Job satisfaction and engagement** were strong predictorsâ€”disengaged employees were more likely to leave.
    

### **3\. Predictive Modeling**

Machine learning models, including **Random Forest, LightGBM, and SVM**, were trained to identify employees at risk of leaving.

*   **SVM performed best**, achieving **99% recall**, ensuring high accuracy in flagging potential attrition cases.
    
*   Imbalanced data was handled using **SMOTE**, improving model effectiveness.
    

### **4\. Strategic Recommendations**

Based on findings, HR teams can implement:

*   **Workload balance & flexible hours** to reduce burnout.
    
*   **Salary adjustments & career progression plans** to retain employees.
    
*   **Satisfaction surveys & mentorship programs** for better engagement.
    
*   **Hybrid work options** for those with long commutes.
    

## **Conclusion**

By leveraging predictive analytics, businesses can **proactively mitigate employee attrition** and build a resilient workforce. Data-driven HR strategies ensure companies retain talent while optimizing workplace culture and productivity.
