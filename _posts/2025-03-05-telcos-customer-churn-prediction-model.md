# **Predicting Customer Churn: A Telecom Industry Case Study with Machine Learning**

### Discover how machine learning can predict telecom customer churn. Learn to clean data, handle imbalances, and deploy models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN) to retain high-risk customers. Perfect for data scientists and telecom professionals.

## **Introduction: The Cost of Customer Churn**

Customer churn is a critical challenge for telecom companiesâ€”losing a customer is **5-25x more expensive** than retaining one. This project tackles churn prediction using **machine learning (ML)**, analyzing a telecom dataset to:

*   **Identify at-risk customers** (e.g., short-tenure, high-cost plans).
    
*   **Optimize retention strategies** with targeted interventions.
    
*   **Reduce revenue loss** through proactive measures.
    

**Tools Used: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, SMOTE, and OpenML.**

## **Key Insights from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

### **1\. Who is Most Likely to Churn?**

*   **Contract Type**: `Month-to-month customers` churn **3x more** than those on 1- or 2-year contracts.
    
*   **Services**: Customers `without tech support` **or** `online security` **churn 2.5x more.**
    
*   **Billing**: `Electronic check users and paperless billing subscribers` show **higher attrition rates**.
    
*   **Demographics**: `Senior citizens and singles` (no partner/dependents) are **more prone to churn.**
    

**_Top factors: Contract type, monthly charges, and tenure._**

### **2\. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

*   Fixed **missing values** in `TotalCharges` (imputed with median).
    
*   Encoded **categorical variables** (e.g., `Contract`, `PaymentMethod`).
    
*   Addressed **class imbalance** (26% churners) using **SMOTE**.
    

## **Machine Learning Approach**

### **Model Comparison**

> I Trained and evaluated 4 algorithms:

| **Model** | **Recall** | **F1-Score** | **Best For** |

|----------------------|------------|--------------|----------------------------------|

| Logistic Regression | 0.83 | 0.79 | Interpretability |

| Random Forest | 0.87 | 0.85 | Balanced performance |

| SVM | 0.88 | 0.83 | High-dimensional data |

| **KNN (Selected)** | **0.91** | 0.82 | **Maximizing churn detection** |

**Why KNN? With 91% recall, it captures the most at-risk customers, Critical for retention campaigns.**

### **Model Deployment**

1.  **Proactive Alerts**: Flag high-risk customers in CRM systems.
    
2.  **Personalized Offers**: Discounts for month-to-month users.
    
3.  **Service Bundles**: Promote tech support + security add-ons.
    

## **Actionable Recommendations**

1.  1\. **Target High-Risk Groups**:
    
    *   Offer **loyalty discounts** to month-to-month customers.
        
    *   Upsell **service bundles** (e.g., internet + security).
        
2.  **Improve Customer Experience**:
    
    *   Proactively check in with **short-tenure customers**.
        
    *   Simplify billing for **electronic check users**.
        
3.  **Monitor & Iterate**:
    
    *   Retrain models quarterly with new churn data.
        
    *   Track intervention success rates.
        

## **Conclusion: Retention as a Growth Strategy**

By leveraging ML, telecom companies can:

*   **Reduce churn** by 20-30% with targeted efforts.
    
*   **Increase the lifetime value** of retained customers.
    
*   **Turn data insights into competitive advantage**.
